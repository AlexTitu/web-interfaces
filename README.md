# web-interfaces

This project contains a MySQL database and a user interface in two different tehnologies for the database
created. The tehnologies I have used for the user interface were Jakarta Server Pages (JSP) and Hibernate.
The back-end of the website is coded in Java, and the front-end consists of technologies like HTML, CSS and
Java Script. For the front-end I have also used an app for making Bootstrapping easier. The website allows
CRUD operations over the MySQL database. The purpose of the site is to allow users to create a profile
about themselves, create profiles of the games they are playing and create the profiles they have in the
added games. This way, the users can compare their stats with the stats of other players and users of the
website. The server is hosted using Apache Tomcat.
